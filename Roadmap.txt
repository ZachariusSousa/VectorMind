Project Roadmap
===============

Overview
--------
This document outlines the development roadmap for a local LLM-based project assistant.
The goal is to create a system that can be pointed to any directory (such as a Unity or software project),
automatically index and vectorize its contents, and provide context-aware assistance through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

The roadmap is divided into milestones that reflect functional maturity, stability, and long-term applicability.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 0: Foundation and Environment
-----------------------------------------
- Set up core development environment.
- Select local LLM runtime (Ollama recommended for MVP).
- Select embedding model for local inference (e.g., BGE-base or BGE-M3).
- Initialize project repository structure.
- Add basic documentation and licensing.

Deliverables:
- Project structure scaffold.
- Working Ollama integration test.
- Initial ROADMAP and README.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 1: Directory Indexing MVP
-----------------------------------------
- Implement directory crawler capable of reading all supported text-based file formats.
- Implement file loaders with filtering by extension.
- Implement basic line-based chunking for code and documentation files.
- Implement embedding pipeline for chunks.
- Initialize local vector database (ChromaDB or equivalent).
- Implement upsert logic for storing document embeddings and metadata.

Deliverables:
- Indexing script capable of processing an entire directory.
- Stored embeddings with file paths and chunk metadata.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 2: Retrieval and Query Engine
-----------------------------------------
- Implement query embedding.
- Implement vector search against indexed project data.
- Implement context assembly and prompt construction.
- Integrate with a local LLM via HTTP API.
- Return structured responses including referenced file paths.

Deliverables:
- API endpoint for retrieval-augmented chat.
- Documented prompt format and retrieval process.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 3: Backend API (FastAPI)
-----------------------------------------
- Create FastAPI application with endpoints:
  - /index (POST): index a directory.
  - /chat (POST): query the project assistant.
- Add request and response models.
- Add logging to track indexing and retrieval operations.
- Add basic error handling (missing folder, unreadable files, empty query, etc.).

Deliverables:
- Fully functional backend service.
- OpenAPI documentation automatically generated.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 4: Basic Frontend Interface
-----------------------------------------
- Implement a minimal React-based interface.
- Allow the user to specify a folder path for indexing.
- Provide a chat interface for sending queries and receiving responses.
- Display file references retrieved during RAG for transparency.

Deliverables:
- Usable web-based UI for interacting with the project assistant.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 5: Project-Aware Enhancements
-----------------------------------------
- Improve chunking using language-aware parsing where applicable.
- Optional integration with tree-sitter for structural code segmentation.
- Add support for framework-specific metadata extraction (e.g., Unity components, JSON configurations).
- Improve prompt generation to include richer metadata (file path, line ranges, symbols).

Deliverables:
- More accurate retrieval for complex codebases.
- Better grounding for LLM responses.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 6: Performance and Stability
-----------------------------------------
- Add caching for embeddings to avoid reprocessing unchanged files.
- Optimize batch embedding workflows.
- Add incremental indexing (detecting modified or deleted files).
- Improve vector store configuration for faster queries.

Deliverables:
- Faster indexing.
- More responsive retrieval for large projects.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 7: Developer Experience and Tooling
-----------------------------------------
- Add CLI interface for indexing and querying without the web UI.
- Provide a configuration file for model selection, chunk sizes, and vector store settings.
- Add logging, error reporting, and optional debug mode.
- Create usage examples and sample datasets.
- Begin preparing public documentation for the project.

Deliverables:
- Developer-focused tools.
- Configurable and maintainable system.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 8: Optional Extensions (Long-Term)
-----------------------------------------
- Build a VSCode or JetBrains plugin that communicates with the backend API.
- Implement project understanding features such as dependency graphs or symbol search.
- Add support for non-text assets via metadata extraction (e.g., Unity prefabs).
- Explore local fine-tuning or LoRA adapters for project-specific reasoning.
- Add multi-user or multi-project support through separate vector collections.

Deliverables:
- Plugins and advanced tooling.
- Enhanced reasoning for domain-specific projects.

-----------------------------------------
Milestone 9: Release Preparation
-----------------------------------------
- Finalize documentation.
- Provide installation and setup guides.
- Add contribution guidelines.
- Tag initial stable release (v1.0.0).

Deliverables:
- Public-ready repository.
- Stable versioned release.
